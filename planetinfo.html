    <h1>Information about Rogue Planets</h1>
    <h2>Scroll down to learn more about rogue planets!</h2>
    Rogue planets, because they aren't tied gravitationally to a star, are
    both more easily studied and less easily observed, as their light isn't
    inhibited by nearby starlight, but they have faint heat signatures that
    are hard to detect and distinguish from brown dwarfs and other tiny
    stellar objects.

    Rogue planets, due to their planet-like size and nature, may provide clues
    into how gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn formed
