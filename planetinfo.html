    <h1>Information about Rogue Planets</h1>
    <h2>Scroll down to learn more about rogue planets!</h2><br />
    <h2>What Are Rogue Planets?</h2>
    <p class="caption">Rogue planets are planetary-mass objects that aren't
        gravitationally tied to a star. These objects have attracted interest
        from scientists for years, even though only a few of them have ever
        been discovered and confirmed.</p>

    <h2>Where Do Rogue Planets Come From?</h2>
    <p class="caption">While the nature and origin of rogue planets and similar
        objects are yet to be known, there are many theories about how rogue planets
        come to be separated from their home stars, including exaggerated
        orbits that cause the star to lose gravitational control of their
        planet, stars and planets being thrown out of orbit by collisions
        or interactions with other stellar bodies, or collisions with other
        planets in orbit around a star. Because of their nature as
        planetary-mass objects, rogue planets could even provide clues to
        the formation process of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn!</p>

    <h2>How Do Scientists Find Rogue Planets?</h2>
    <p class="caption">Because rogue planets aren't very luminous in visible
        light spectra, and are not gravitationally tied to any star, they are
        very hard to detect. Some telescopes are able to detect the faint
        infrared light these planets give off, much in the same way they
        detect brown dwarfs, but scientists mostly rely on gravitational
        lensing to find rogue planets. When a rogue planet passes in front of
        a star, they may cause the starâ€™s luminosity to change for a period of
        time. The length of time this period of increased brightness lasts
        allows scientists to discern the size of the planet. Larger rogue
        planets are easier to detect, as their period lasts for several days,
        but smaller rogue planets, with Earth-sized masses, are harder to
        detect, as their periods last for only a few hours. After a planet
        has been detected, their lack of star parent becomes an advantage
        to scientists for further studying, as the light from the planet can
        make its way to Earth, uninhibited by starlight.


    <h2>How Many Rogue Planets Are There?</h2>
    <p class="caption">Scientists estimate there could be as many as 50
        billion rogue planets in our Milky Way galaxy!</p>

    <h2>Difference Between a Brown Dwarf and a Rogue Planet</h2>
    <p class="caption">There is a very fine line between a brown dwarf and a
        rogue planet. In fact, this line is so fine that the IAU has
        classified rogue planets as "sub-brown dwarves"! The main difference
        between these two objects, however, is mass: rogue planets can be as
        massive as 12 times the mass of Jupiter, while brown dwarves have a
        mass between 13 and 80 times that mass.
