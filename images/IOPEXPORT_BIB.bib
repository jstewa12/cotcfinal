	abstract = {We report on the discovery that the nearby (∼6 pc) photometrically variable T2.5 dwarf SIMP J013656.5+093347 is a likely member of the ∼200 Myr old Carina-Near moving group with a probability of >99.9% based on its full kinematics. Our  measurement of 50.9 ± 0.8 km s−1 combined with the known rotation period inferred from variability measurements provide a lower limit of 1.01 ± 0.02  on the radius of SIMP 0136+0933, an independent verification that it must be younger than ∼950 Myr, according to evolution models. We estimate a field interloper probability of 0.2% based on the density of field T0–T5 dwarfs. At the age of Carina-Near, SIMP 0136+0933 has an estimated mass of 12.7 ± 1.0  and is predicted to have burned roughly half of its original deuterium. SIMP 0136+0933 is the closest known young moving group member to the Sun and is one of only a few known young T dwarfs, making it an important benchmark for understanding the atmospheres of young planetary-mass objects.}
