    <p>Interesting Properties/Factoids</p>
        <p class="caption">WISE 0855−0714 is the closest rogue planet to
            Earth! It is also as cold as the North Pole! Finally, scientists
            believe it has potential to be a brown dwarf, due to the
            commonality of brown dwarfs, although they are confident it is a
            rogue planet due to it's smaller mass.</p>
    <p>How It Was Discovered</p>
        <p class="caption">WISE 0855−0714 was discovered using two infrared
            telescopes, NASA's Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WISE) and the
            Spitzer telescope. These telescopes, by observing the universe in
            infrared light, allow NASA to see parts of the universe unseen in
            visible light.</p>
