    <h1>What If Earth was a Rogue Planet?</h1>
    <h2>
        What would happen to Earth and life on it if <br /> it got knocked out of the Sun's orbit?
    </h2>
    <p class="caption">
        Although the likelihood is low, there is a chance that something could
        knock the Earth out of the Sunâ€™s orbit. If this were to happen, the
        Earth would go shooting off into space and become a rogue planet.<br /><br />
        This would bode ill for the planet and all of life on it. Life on
        Earth relies on the sun for its survival, specifically for light and
        heat. If Earth was to become a rogue planet, everything, including
        the oceans, would freeze very quickly. Even the atmosphere would
        freeze, and in a solid state it would fall down to the Earth. Although
        the core of the Earth would still maintain its high temperature, the
        freezing of the surface would happen before life on Earth would have
        time to figure out how to build a functioning society that relied
        solely on this geothermal energy. <br /><br />Another issue that would arise due
        to the lack of sunlight, would be the inability for plants to carry
        out the process of photosynthesis. This would impact all life on Earth,
        as humans and animals would no longer have their food sources.
