        <p class="caption">2MASS J1119–1137 is actually a binary system of
            two objects, each with a mass of around 4 times Jupiter's. This
            makes 2MASS J1119–1137 the lowest-mass binary system discovered
            so far in the universe!</p>
    <p>How It Was Discovered</p>
        <p class="caption">2MASS J1119–1137 was discovered using NASA's
            Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, along with help from
            other telescopes. It was found thanks to its unusually high
            levels of infrared radiation.</p>
