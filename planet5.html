    <p>Interesting Properties/Factoids</p>
        <p class="caption">It was first thought that SIMP J013656.5+093347
            was a brown dwarf, but it was proven in 2017 that it was
            more planet-like than scientists had observed. The object also
            has weather, making its discovery and new classification
            particularly interesting.</p>
    <p>How It Was Discovered</p>
        <p class="caption">Similarly to SDSS J111010.01+011613.1,
            SIMP J013656.5+093347 was discovered during the BASS-Ultracool
            survey, which was dedicated to finding and observing
            rogue planets and similarly-massed objects using the BANYAN 2
            tool.</p>
