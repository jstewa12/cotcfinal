    <p>Interesting Properties/Factoids</p>
        <p class="caption">Scientists are not certain whether CFBDSIR
            2149−0403 is a rogue planet or a brown dwarf, due to its location
            within a tightly-knit, moving group of stars.</p>
    <p>How It Was Discovered</p>
        <p class="caption">CFBDSIR 2149−0403 was discovered by scientists in
            Hawaii and Chile, using two infrared telescopes, the
            Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope,
            designed to look for young planets. It was discovered in an area
            of space 1,000 times that of the moon, and was the only one of its
            kind found within that area.</p>
