    <p>Interesting Properties/Factoids</p>
        <p class="caption">PSO J318.5-22 is the brighest rogue planet we can
            see, one of the least massive free-floating objects, and the first
            planet discovered outside of our solar system to have weather --
            consisting of iron rain! Also, a day on PSO J318.5-22 would be
            only 5 hours!
    <p>How It Was Discovered</p>
        <p class="caption">PSO J318.5-22 was discovered using the PS1
            telescope, a telescope designed to search for brown dwarf stars,
            which are extremely hard to detect because of their low
            temperatures, by scanning for their radiation signals. The
            discovery of PSO J318.5-22 and it's classification as a rogue
            planet were confirmed by infrared telescopes in Hawaii.</p>
